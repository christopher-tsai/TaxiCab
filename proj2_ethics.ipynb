    "# Data Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to consider data ethics and the NYC taxi dataset is no exception. In this notebook we will give you some food for thought and prompt you to think critically about some important aspects of this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please choose 2 out of the following 4 questions and write thoughtful responses to your chosen questions. You should make sure to backup your responses with proofs, counter examples, real world data, etc. We encourage you to not only draw upon lectures/online resources but also to debate with your peers! Make sure to submit this notebook to datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We downloaded the taxi data from a publicly available endpoint (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). This means anyone can access this dataset. Can you think of some other external dataset that can be joined with the taxi data that can be utilized to target specific demographics or invade privacy? How could this dataset be used? For example, if we join taxi dataset and street camera, it will be easy to findout who the passenger is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Many people use ride sharing services like Uber or Lyft. Unlike taxi companies, Uber and Lyft know who you are and exactly where you are going. Although the data is not publicy accessible, you can still access part of the data through limited accessed API that's only opened to paid partners (https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/references/api/v1.2/requests-request_id-get). What can a third party do with these data? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If Josh is the chief data scientist at Uber, he has access to all the Uber data. He wants to investigate racial discrimination against drivers by evaluating and performing hypothesis testing on a ride ratings dataset. For example, he can test the hypothesis that given the same level of service, an Asian driver will get different rating from a Caucasian driver. Can Josh perform such experiment? State your assumptions on the data available at Uber.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let's say that the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (NYC MTA) aggregates data from taxis, Ubers, and Lyfts, and determines that people in Brooklyn rarely use taxis/rideshares. The director of the MTA signs a bill to devote all transportation infrastructure funds solely to Manhattan; what is(are) the flaw(s) in making that assumption?"
